# dobsonMotorizedBase
This site contains source code for my Dobson motorized telescope base. It was originally designed for Celestron C90 Mac and Canon 450D/Rebel DSLR camera, but can be adapted (or used directly) for similar setups. 

You can find the whole project description here (in Polish):

The project has been splint into number of phases:
* Mark I - the base is moved manually, no code/electronics needed,
* Mark II - the base position is controlled and displayed on a LCD,
* Mark III: the base X and Y axis is motorized, there is Arduino with CNC board controlling motors,
* Mark IV: user can select an object on the sky - and the telescope tube will be moved to this position,
* Mark V:Â support for astrophotography,

Project is now entering Mark II. I'm developing code for the ESP32.
