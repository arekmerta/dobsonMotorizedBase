Early version

This is micro:bit based remote shutter:
- Connects to a DSLR wia shutter port,
- Can be reached by BLE to set number of shots, delay and start shoting session

As DSLR I use canon 450d

**NOTE**
This may be dangerous, can damage or destroy you camera. I recommend that you use original tools/accessories from camera makers. 
Use this at own risk. I take no responsibilities what  may happen.
