# What is it?
This is micro:bit based remote shutter:
* Connects to a DSLR via shutter port (project: eosShutter),
* Can be reached by BLE to set number of shots, delay, start shooting session and get shootting status (project: eosShutterBLE)

./eosShutter: micro:bit code for basic operation, just presentation
./eosShutterBLE: micro:bit code - fully operable over BLE
./eosShutterBLE/androidApp: MIT AppInventor project for android app; also here: http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#4827855079211008



As DSLR I use canon 450d.

# Environment
Use with Arduino IDE.

# Configuration
Board:BBC micro:bit
SoftDevice: S110

# Warning note
This software may damage or destroy you camera. I highly recommend that you only use original tools/accessories from camera makers.
Use this at own risk. I take no any responsibilities what may happen (be damaged or destroyed), no guarantees that it will work.  

# Status
Early version - still requires rework
