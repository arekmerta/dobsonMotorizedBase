**Warning** Early version  
  
This is micro:bit based remote shutter:
* Connects to a DSLR via shutter port (project: eosShutter),
* Can be reached by BLE to set number of shots, delay and start shoting session (project: eosShutterBLE)
  
As DSLR I use canon 450d.  
  
**NOTE**  
  
This may be dangerous, can damage or destroy you camera. I recommend that you only use original tools/accessories from camera makers. 
Use this at own risk. I take no any responsibilities what  may happen.  
  
**Thank you**
